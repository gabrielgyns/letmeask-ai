| Room w/ no questions | <img width="912" height="710" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22aba794-ae0f-4542-8df4-54ebd159f3d1" /> |
| When we record an audio | <img width="690" height="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f33cd66-a036-4558-bed9-edc4d0f11a51" />
| We separete it in chunks of audio trasncribing and extracting embeddings to handle searchs by vectors in postgresql | <img width="1660" height="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce1bbe4-f051-456b-bead-8303eafe0f11" /> |
| Then, if we make a question related to the audio mentioned (where similarity using the embeddings got at least 0.7), AI will reply it. | <img width="906" height="808" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f0fddd-449e-449d-aa5d-b622b7253bb1" /> |
| A future possible feature would be another person reply manually. | <img width="938" height="1154" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7589e577-c3c3-4f36-a1b5-295bdfcfc7d9" /> |
| If it does not find similarity, it will reply based on common knowledge from ai. | <img width="938" height="1154" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7589e577-c3c3-4f36-a1b5-295bdfcfc7d9" /> |
